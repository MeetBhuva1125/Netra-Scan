# <b>Netra scan</b> - <em>Deep learning Project</em>

## Introduction
Netra-Scan is a web-based application that leverages deep learning to detect various retinal diseases such as DME, Drusen, Normal, and CNV. The project utilizes a tailored Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on Xception architecture to analyze and predict retinal conditions.
